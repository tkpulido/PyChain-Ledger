# PyChain-Ledger
This application records transaction details, such as the sender, the reciever, and the amount being transfered. In order to add the block to the chain you simply click the "Add Block" button. There is also a slide bar that allows for one to change the difficulty to control how fast the block is able to be mined.  After several blocks are added, one is able to validate the chain with the "Validate Chain" button which will return True if nothing has been tampered with.
